# Password Generator

A simple Python console application that generates a secure, random password based on user preferences.

The game begins by asking the user for the minimum length of the password and whether to include numbers and special characters. The program then generates a password that meets the chosen criteria.

For example, a sample gameplay might look like this:
```text
Enter the minimum length: 10
Do you want to have numbers (Y/N)?
Y
Do you want to have special characters (Y/N)?
Y
The Generated Password Is:  j8#Kp@r2Qz
```
This program is great for learning Python concepts like functions, loops, conditional statements, string manipulation, and random selection.

## Features

- Generates random passwords with user-defined minimum length.
- Optionally includes numbers.
- Optionally includes special characters.
